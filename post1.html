            <h1>📝 BLOG 1 — TryHackMe: Introduction to Cyber Security (My Experience)</h1>
            <h4>Date: 2025</h4>
            <h4>Category: Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>I recently completed the Introduction to Cyber Security room on TryHackMe, and it became one of the most useful beginner lessons for me. Before starting the room, I only knew basic ideas about online safety, but now I understand much more about how cyber threats actually work. The room explained different types of malware, how hackers target people, and why strong passwords are important.</p>
            <p>I also learned about multi-factor authentication, phishing attacks, ransomware, and safe internet habits. The room included simple tasks where I answered questions, explored examples of attacks, and learned how to protect accounts. The interactive style made everything easier to understand, even as a beginner.</p>
            <p>This room was my first real step into cybersecurity, and it gave me confidence to continue learning. Now I plan to complete more TryHackMe rooms, practice networking labs, and slowly improve my technical and practical skills. It feels motivating to see progress every day.</p>
