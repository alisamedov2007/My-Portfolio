            <h1>📝 BLOG 2 — My Linux Learning Journey (Beginner Notes)</h1>
            <h4>Date: 2025</h4>
            <h4>Category: Linux</h4>
            <p>I started learning Linux because it is one of the most important skills for cybersecurity, programming, and server administration. During the past week, I practiced many basic terminal commands such as ls, cd, mkdir, rm, cat, and cp. These commands helped me understand how to move between directories, create files, remove them, and read their content.</p>
            <p>I also learned about file permissions, users, groups, and how Linux controls access to different resources. Using the chmod command was especially interesting, because it showed me how system security depends on correct permissions. At first, working only in the terminal felt difficult, but after practicing daily, it became much more comfortable.</p>
            <p>Now I understand why many cybersecurity specialists prefer Linux: it gives more control, more tools, and more flexibility. In the future, I want to study shell scripting, package management, basic networking commands, and useful security tools like nmap. My goal is to strengthen my Linux skills step by step.</p>
